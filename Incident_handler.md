** Incident handler's journal

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will review the details of a security incident and
document the incident using your incident handler\'s journal.
Previously, you learned about the importance of documentation in the
incident response process. You\'ve also learned how an incident
handler\'s journal is used to record information about security
incidents as they are handled. 

Throughout this course, you can apply your documentation skills using
your incident handler\'s journal. With this journal, you can record
information about the experiences you will have analyzing security
incident scenarios through the course activities.

By the time you complete this course you will have multiple entries in
your incident handler\'s journal that you can use as a helpful reference
to recall concepts and tools. Later, you\'ll add this document to your
cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers
or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional
portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [[Create a
cybersecurity
portfolio]{.underline}](https://www.coursera.org/learn/detection-and-response/resources/H3ujO). 

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step
instructions.

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care
services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at
approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable
to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business
operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files
and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed
on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company\'s files
were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known
to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In
exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note
demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company\'s network by
using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of
the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that
installed malware on the employee\'s computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which
encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical
patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations.
The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact
several organizations to report the incident and receive technical
assistance.

### Step 2: Review the scenario

Review the details of the scenario. Consider the following key details:

-   A small U.S. health care clinic experienced a security incident on
    Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. which severely disrupted their business
    operations.

-   The cause of the security incident was a phishing email that
    contained a malicious attachment. Once it was downloaded, ransomware
    was deployed encrypting the organization\'s computer files.

-   An organized group of unethical hackers left a ransom note stating
    that the company\'s files were encrypted and demanded money in
    exchange for the decryption key

### Step 3: Record a journal entry

## 

Be sure to include the following elements in your completed activity: 

-   The journal entry date and number

-   A description of the journal entry

-   1-2 sentences addressing each of the 5 W\'s of the scenario:

    -   Who caused the incident?

    -   What happened?

    -   When did the incident occur?

    -   Where did the incident happen?

    -   Why did the incident happen?

|              |     on the company\'s systems, encrypting critical    |
|              |     files. The attackers\' motivation appears to be   |
|              |     financial because the ransom note they left       |
|              |     demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the |
|              |     decryption key.                                   |

# **Step 1: Access supporting materials**

## INCIDENT FINAL REPORT

### **Executive summary**

The organization experienced a security incident on December 28, 2022,
at 7:20 p.m., PT, during which an individual was able to gain
unauthorized access to customer personal identifiable information (PII)
and financial information. Approximately 50,000 customer records were
affected. The financial impact of the incident is estimated to be
\$100,000 in direct costs and potential loss of revenue. The incident is
now closed and a thorough investigation has been conducted.

### **Timeline**

At approximately 3:13 p.m., PT, on December 22, 2022, an employee
received an email from an external email address. The email sender
claimed that they had successfully stolen customer data. In exchange for
not releasing the data to public forums, the sender requested a \$25,000
cryptocurrency payment. The employee assumed the email was spam and
deleted it.

On December 28, 2022, the same employee received another email from the
same sender. This email included a sample of the stolen customer data
and an increased payment demand of \$50,000.

On the same day, the employee notified the security team, who began
their investigation into the incident. Between December 28 and December
31, 2022, the security team concentrated on determining how the data was
stolen and the extent of the theft.

### **Investigation**

The security team received the alert and traveled on-site to begin the
investigation.

The root cause of the incident was identified as a vulnerability in the
e-commerce web application. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to
perform a forced browsing attack and access customer transaction data by
modifying the order number included in the URL string of a purchase
confirmation page. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to access
customer purchase confirmation pages, exposing customer data, which the
attacker then collected and exfiltrated.

After confirming the web application vulnerability, the security team
analyzed the web application access logs. The logs indicated that the
attacker accessed the information of thousands of purchase confirmation
pages.

### **Response and remediation**

The organization collaborated with the public relations department to
disclose the data breach to its customers. Additionally, the
organization offered free identity protection services to customers
affected by the incident.

After the security team reviewed the associated web server logs, the
cause of the attack was very clear. There was a single log source
showing an exceptionally high volume of sequentially listed customer
orders.

### **Recommendations**

To prevent future recurrences, we are taking the following actions:

-   Perform routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

-   Implement the following access control mechanisms:

    -   Implement allow listing to allow access to a specified set of
        URLs and automatically block all requests outside of this URL
        range.

    -   Ensure that only authenticated users are authorized access to
        content.
